## Dashboard

The dashboard is the first page that you see after being logged in. It contains an overview of all datasets that you have access to.

## Filtering Datasets

You can currently filter across 4 different types:
1. Location (The beamline creationLocation)
2. Groups (The ownerGroup/pGroup that the dataset belongs to)
3. Type - e.g. raw data or derived data
4. Keywords - the tags added to the datasets
5. Start - End Date (This will show all datasets captured between the dates that you have set)

The text fields provide an auto completion, which becomes visible as you type. 

One click on the date calendar selects the start date and a second selects the end date. Make sure you select 2 dates.

## Searching

The text field at the top of the screen allows you to search the metadata for any word contained in the metadata (but not arbitrary substrings).
