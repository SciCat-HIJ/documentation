# Contributing

There are 3 core ways to get involved with the Data Catalogue project:

1. Documentation - Fixing errors, covering weaker areas, adding examples
2. Gitlab Issues - This should be the first area to focus on for those that want to amend the code. To see how the project is developed, see the [Git Workflow page.](/./Devops/General/Development_Methodology/git_workflow.md)
3. Testing

For information about the development method we follow, please check [Development Methodology.](/./Devops/General/Development_Methodology/git_workflow.md)

## Issues



## Merge Requests

There should be **no** pushing directly to the `master` or `develop` branches. To implement a fix, one should open a branch with the naming: `hotfix/ISSUE-NAME` from the `develop` branch and complete all work there. When it is complete, a Merge Request should be opened that follows this template:
