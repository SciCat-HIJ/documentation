# Contributing

There are 3 core ways to get involved with the Data Catalogue project:

1. Documentation - Fixing errors, covering weaker areas, adding examples
2. Gitlab Issues - This should be the first area to focus on for those that want to amend the code. To see how the project is developed, see the [Git Workflow page.](/./Devops/General/Development_Methodology/git_workflow.md)
3. Testing
