# Ingesting Data into SciCat

This manual collects various approaches for ingesting data

1. [Ingest Manual from PSI](ingestManual.md) : contains partly tools, which are not yet open sourced, but soon will
2. [Ingest Instructions from ESS](IngestManual_ESS.md)
3. [Minimalistic example via CURL](GettingMetadataIntoScicat.md)
